## Weekly fix
* Fixed a bug where clicking on a filter would change weekly to the most recent week
* Clicking on a week tag will now open weekly
* Fixed a bug where weekly popup would appear over notifications if left open

## Deleted user causing crash
* If a user caused a notification and has removed their account, the app would crash. Fixed that bug

And a lot more bugfixes and optimizations. We hope you enjoy!
