Thank you!

## Editor settings
We use VSCode as our primary editor. The most important plugins we use are:
1. Eslint
2. Editorconfig
3. Beautify
4. Path Intellisense

We use es6 pretty much everywhere. Please use it when you are contributing.

Any functions or classes you are adding must be commented.

If you have questions related to the structure of the application please ask me (@tahnik). If you are curious about the design please ask Hampus (@rekkyrek)
